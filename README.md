# MNIST-fashion-classification
This is IPython notebook in which i have used neural network to classify the mnist fashion dataset into 10 different categories based on their features 
In this classifier i have used 2 layers NN and last layer is the softmax layer of 10 nodes that outputs the probability corresponding to the particular class
